                  <h2>Why</h2>
                  <h3 id="everyone">Designing for everyone</h3>
                  <p>Designing for the web means considering the full range of users, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive disabilities who rely on tools like screen readers, voice control, or alternative keyboards. By understanding how different people interact with technology, designers can create websites that are not only functional but intuitive and welcoming, ensuring that everyone can access content, complete tasks, and participate online without unnecessary barriers.</p>
                  <p>Many people still encounter significant obstacles online. For example, low-contrast text can make reading difficult for users with visual impairments, videos without captions exclude those who are deaf or hard of hearing, and complex navigation can frustrate users with cognitive or motor challenges. Even common features like drop-down menus or dynamic content updates can be inaccessible if they aren’t designed with assistive technology in mind, highlighting the need for thoughtful, inclusive web design that anticipates these challenges.</p>
                  <h3 id="web">The web's evolution & grassroots change</h3>
                  <p>The web’s evolution has been shaped by both technology and grassroots advocacy. In the late 1990s, designers struggled with sites full of incompatible code, inline scripts, and table-heavy layouts that made accessibility and maintenance difficult. The Web Standards Project promoted semantic HTML, CSS, and unobtrusive JavaScript, separating content from presentation and making sites faster, lighter, and more accessible, including for screen readers and alternative devices. Projects like CSS Zen Garden proved that beautiful, creative designs could still follow these standards, showing that accessibility and usability could enhance the web for everyone.</p>
                  <h3 id="improves">Why accessibility improves experiences for all</h3>
                  <p>Designing for accessibility improves experiences for everyone, not just those with disabilities. Clear, logical structure, meaningful headings, and consistent navigation create affordances that help all users intuitively understand and interact with a site. Features like captions, alt text, and high-contrast visuals not only support users with sensory or cognitive differences but also enhance readability and usability for everyone. The Inclusion Principle emphasizes this approach, showing that when we design for the “neediest” user, we create solutions that empower all users. Accessible design becomes universal, blending usability, clarity, and organization into a seamless experience where everyone can navigate, understand, and enjoy digital content without barriers.</p>
                  <h3 id="ethics">The ethics + responsibility of designers</h3>
                  <p>Designers have an ethical responsibility to ensure their work is inclusive, accessible, and fair, because design decisions directly impact who is able to participate in everyday life. The story of Haben Girma illustrates how access is not a favor, but a civil right. When her college cafeteria failed to provide accessible menus, she used the Americans with Disabilities Act to demand equal access, sparking meaningful change. Her experience shows that accessibility depends not only on laws, but on people who are willing to advocate for inclusion. Similarly, contemporary designers and researchers, such as those creating navigation tools for blind and visually impaired users, demonstrate how ethical design extends beyond compliance to actively empowering users. Ethical design means anticipating diverse needs, challenging exclusionary practices, and using design as a tool for equity and justice.</p>
                  <h3 id="innovation">Innovation through accessibility</h3>
                  <p>Accessible design often drives creativity and innovation rather than limiting it. When designers are challenged to accommodate diverse abilities, they are pushed to rethink traditional interactions and develop new tools, interfaces, and technologies. This has led to innovations such as voice-controlled systems, screen readers, haptic feedback, and more inclusive mobile applications that benefit a wide range of users beyond their original audience. By designing with accessibility in mind from the start, creators are encouraged to explore new solutions, experiment with emerging technologies, and build more flexible, adaptive systems. In this way, accessibility becomes a catalyst for technological growth and creative problem-solving, not a constraint.</p>
