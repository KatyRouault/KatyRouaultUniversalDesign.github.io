                  <h2>What</h2>
                  <h3>Definition of Universal Design</h3>
                  <p>Universal Design is the practice of creating products and environments that are usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for special adaptation. It goes beyond basic accessibility compliance by emphasizing inclusive design from the beginning rather than adding fixes later. While accessibility focuses on removing barriers for people with disabilities, usability focuses on ease of use for all users. Universal Design brings both together, aiming to create experiences that are equitable, flexible, intuitive, and supportive of diverse abilities and needs.</p>
                  <h3>The Language of Design</h3>
                  <p>Visual design elements such as contrast, color, hierarchy, and typography play a crucial role in accessibility and usability. Strong contrast improves readability for users with low vision, color theory helps avoid relying on color alone to convey information, and visual hierarchy guides users through content in a clear, logical way. Thoughtful typography enhances legibility and comprehension. When these design principles are applied intentionally, they create interfaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also easier to understand and navigate for everyone.</p>
                  <h3>Interaction Design & Information Architecture</h3>
                  <p>Interaction design and information architecture shape how users move through and interact with a website. Clear user flows, predictable navigation, and organized content structures help users find information efficiently and with minimal confusion. Well-designed information architecture reduces cognitive load and supports users with attention, memory, or motor challenges. Intuitive interactions ensure that users can complete tasks easily, whether they are using a mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, or assistive technology.</p>
                  <h3>Web Standards & Semantics</h3>
                  <p>Web standards and semantic HTML provide the foundation for accessible digital experiences. Using proper HTML elements for headings, lists, buttons, and landmarks allows assistive technologies like screen readers to accurately interpret and communicate content to users. Standards ensure consistency across browsers and devices while improving compatibility with accessibility tools. When designers follow semantic and standards-based coding practices, they create websites that are more resilient, maintainable, and universally usable.</p>
                  <h3>Accessible Components of a Website</h3>
                  <p>Page structure is essential for accessibility and comprehension. Headings create a clear content hierarchy that allows users to scan and navigate efficiently, especially for those using screen readers or keyboard navigation. Lists group related information in a logical format, making content easier to process and understand. Without proper structure, content becomes harder to navigate, increasing frustration and limiting access for many users.</p>
                  <p>Metadata such as page titles, meta descriptions, and ARIA labels provide critical information to both users and assistive technologies. Descriptive page titles help users understand where they are within a site, while ARIA attributes communicate the purpose and state of interface elements that may not be clear from visuals alone. When metadata is used correctly, it enhances navigation, supports screen reader users, and ensures that interactive components are fully understandable.</p>
                  <p>Accessible tables use proper header cells, scope attributes, and logical reading order so screen readers can accurately describe relationships between data. Without these features, tables become confusing or unusable for users who rely on auditory output. Well-structured tables ensure that complex information remains understandable and navigable, allowing all users equal access to data and content.</p>
                  <h3>Mobile-First Accessibility</h3>
                  <p>Mobile-first design prioritizes the smallest screens and most constrained environments first, which naturally supports accessibility. Designing for touch, limited space, and variable lighting conditions leads to clearer layouts, larger interactive elements, and simplified navigation. Because many users rely on mobile devices as their primary access point to the web, mobile-first accessibility ensures that inclusive design is built into the experience from the start.</p>
                  <h3>Assistive Technologies</h3>
                  <p>Assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, switch devices, voice input, and captions allow users with disabilities to interact with digital content. These tools rely on well-structured, semantic, and accessible code to function correctly. When websites are designed without considering assistive technologies, users may lose access to basic features like navigation, forms, or media. Designing with these tools in mind ensures full participation in digital spaces.</p>
                  <h3>Accessibility Assessment</h3>
                  <p>Accessibility assessment involves evaluating how well a website meets inclusive design standards. Automated testing tools can quickly detect common issues like missing alt text or poor color contrast, but they cannot fully assess usability or real-world user experience. Manual testing, including keyboard navigation and screen reader evaluation, is essential for identifying deeper accessibility barriers. Together, automated and manual testing create a more complete picture of a site’s accessibility and effectiveness.</p>
