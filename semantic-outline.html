        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The monarch butterfly (<em>Danaus plexippus</em>) is one of the most recognizable and well-studied butterflies in the world. Known for its striking orange, black, and white pattern, it plays an important role in pollination and ecological balance.

      <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat and Migration</h2>
        <p>
          Monarchs are famous for their incredible migration, traveling thousands of miles from North America to central Mexico. During this migration, multiple generations are born and die before the final generation returns north.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="life-cycle">
        <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          The monarchâ€™s life cycle consists of four stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult butterfly. Each stage represents a transformation that is both delicate and vital to survival.

      <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>
          Monarch caterpillars feed exclusively on milkweed, which provides them with toxins that make them distasteful to predators. Adult butterflies feed on nectar from various flowers.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="threats">
        <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
        <p>
          Habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change have led to a decline in monarch populations. Conservation efforts focus on planting milkweed, protecting overwintering sites, and raising public awareness.
