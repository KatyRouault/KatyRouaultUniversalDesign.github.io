                <h2>Monarch butterfly</h2>
                <p>The monarch butterfly or simply monarch (Danaus plexippus) is a milkweed butterfly (subfamily Danainae) in the family Nymphalidae.[6] Other common names, depending on region, include milkweed, common tiger, wanderer, and black-veined brown.[7] It is among the most familiar of North American butterflies and an iconic pollinator,[8] although it is not an especially effective pollinator of milkweeds.[9] Its wings feature an easily recognizable black, orange, and white pattern, with a wingspan of 8.9–10.2 cm (3.5–4.0 in).[10] A Müllerian mimic, the viceroy butterfly, is similar in color and pattern, but is markedly smaller and has an extra black stripe across each hindwing.</p>
                <p>The eastern North American monarch population is notable for its annual southward late-summer/autumn instinctive migration from the northern and central United States and southern Canada to Florida and Mexico.[6] During the fall migration, monarchs cover thousands of miles, with a corresponding multigenerational return north in spring. The western North American population of monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains often migrates to sites in southern California, but have been found in overwintering Mexican sites, as well.[11][12] Non-migratory populations are found further south in the Americas, and in parts of Europe, Oceania, and Southeast Asia.</p>

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>The name "monarch" is believed to have been given in honor of King William III of England, as the butterfly's main color is that of the king's secondary title, Prince of Orange.[13] The monarch was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae of 1758 and placed in the genus Papilio.[14] In 1780, Jan Krzysztof Kluk used the monarch as the type species for a new genus, Danaus. Although works published between at least 1883 and 1944 identified the species as Anosia plexippus,[15] Anosia was generally considered a subgenus of Danaus.[16]</p>
                <p>Danaus (Ancient Greek Δαναός), a great-grandson of Zeus, was a mythical king in Egypt or Libya, who founded Argos; Plexippus (Πλήξιππος) was one of the 50 sons of Aegyptus, the twin brother of Danaus. In Homeric Greek, his name means "one who urges on horses", i.e., "rider" or "charioteer".[17] In the tenth edition of Systema Naturae, at the bottom of page 467,[18] Linnaeus wrote that the names of the Danai festivi, the division of the genus to which Papilio plexippus belonged, were derived from the sons of Aegyptus. Linnaeus divided his large genus Papilio, containing all known butterfly species, into what we would now call subgenera. The Danai festivi formed one of the "subgenera", containing colorful species, as opposed to the Danai candidi, containing species with bright white wings. Linnaeus wrote: "Danaorum Candidorum nomina a filiabus Danai Aegypti, Festivorum a filiis mutuatus sunt." (English: "The names of the Danai candidi have been derived from the daughters of Danaus, those of the Danai festivi from the sons of Aegyptus.").</p>
                <p>Robert Michael Pyle suggested Danaus is a masculinized version of Danaë (Greek Δανάη), Danaus's great-great-granddaughter, to whom Zeus came as a shower of gold, which seemed to him a more appropriate source for the name of this butterfly.[19]</p>

                <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
                <p>Monarchs belong to the subfamily Danainae of the family Nymphalidae. Danainae was formerly considered a separately family Danaidae.[20] The three species of monarch butterflies are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>D. plexippus, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the species known most commonly as the monarch butterfly ranging from North America to northern South America. Its range extends worldwide, including Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, and the Pacific Islands.</li>
                    <li>D. erippus, the southern monarch, was described by Pieter Cramer in 1775. This species is found in tropical and subtropical latitudes of South America, mainly in Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and southern Peru. The South American monarch and the North American monarch may have been one species at one time. Some researchers believe the southern monarch separated from the monarch's population some two million years ago, at the end of the Pliocene. Sea levels were higher, and the entire Amazonas lowland was a vast expanse of brackish swamp that offered limited butterfly habitat.[16]</li>
                    <li>D. cleophile, the Jamaican monarch, described by Jean-Baptiste Godart in 1819, ranges from Jamaica to Hispaniola.[2]</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Six subspecies and two color morphs of D. plexippus have been identified:[7]</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>D. p. plexippus – nominate subspecies, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the migratory subspecies known from most of North America.
                        <ul>
                            <li>D. p. p. "form nivosus", the white monarch commonly found on Oahu, Hawaii, and rarely in other locations.[21]</li>
                            <li>D. p. p. (as yet unnamed) – a color morph lacking some wing vein markings.[22]</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>D. p. nigrippus (Richard Haensch, 1909) – South America - as forma: Danais [sic] archippus f. nigrippus. Hay-Roe et al. in 2007 identified this taxon as a subspecies[23]</li>
                    <li>D. p. megalippe (Jacob Hübner, [1826]) – nonmigratory subspecies, and is found from Florida and Georgia southwards, throughout the Caribbean and Central America to the Amazon River.</li>
                    <li>D. p. leucogyne (Arthur G. Butler, 1884) − St. Thomas</li>
                    <li>D. p. portoricensis Austin Hobart Clark, 1941 − Puerto Rico</li>
                    <li>D. p. tobagi Austin Hobart Clark, 1941 − Tobago</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The population level of the white morph in Oahu is nearing 10%. On other Hawaiian islands, the white morph occurs at a relatively low frequency. White monarchs (D. p. p. "form nivosus") have been found throughout the world, including Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the United States.[21] However, some taxonomists disagree on these classifications.[16][23]</p>

                <h2>Genome</h2>
                <p>The monarch was the first butterfly to have its genome sequenced.[24]: 12  The 273-million-base pair draft sequence includes a set of 16,866 protein-coding genes. The genome provides researchers insights into migratory behavior, the circadian clock, juvenile hormone pathways, and microRNAs that are differentially expressed between summer and migratory monarchs.[25] More recently, the genetic basis of monarch migration and warning coloration has been described.[26]</p>
                <p>No genetic differentiation exists between the migratory populations of eastern and western North America.[24]: 16  Recent research has identified the specific areas in the genome of the monarch that regulate migration. No genetic difference is seen between a migrating and nonmigrating monarch, but the gene is expressed in migrating monarchs, but not expressed in nonmigrating monarchs.[27]</p>
                <p>A 2015 publication identified genes from wasp bracoviruses in the genome of the North American monarch[28] leading to articles about monarch butterflies being genetically modified organisms.[29]</p>

            <section  id="Life-cycle">
                <h2>Genome</h2>
                <p>Like all Lepidoptera, monarchs undergo complete metamorphosis; their life cycle has four phases: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Monarchs transition from eggs to adults during warm summer temperatures in as little as 25 days, extending to as many as seven weeks during cool spring conditions. During their development, both larvae and their milkweed hosts are vulnerable to weather extremes, predators, parasites, and diseases; commonly fewer than 10% of monarch eggs and caterpillars survive.[24]: 21–22 </p>
                <h3 id="Egg">Egg</h3>
                <p>The egg is derived from materials ingested as a larva and from the spermatophores received from males during mating.[30] Female monarchs lay eggs singly, most often on the underside of a young leaf of a milkweed plant during the spring and summer.[31] Females secrete a small amount of glue to attach their eggs directly to the plant. They typically lay 300 to 500 eggs over a two- to five-week period.[32]</p>
                <p>Eggs are cream colored or light green, ovate to conical in shape, and about 1.2 mm × 0.9 mm (0.047 in × 0.035 in) in size. The eggs weigh less than 0.5 mg (0.0077 gr) each and have raised ridges that form longitudinally from the point to apex to the base. Although each egg is 1⁄1000 the mass of the female, she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs.[30] The number of eggs laid by a female, which may mate several times, can reach 1,180.[33]</p>
                <p>Eggs take three to eight days to develop and hatch into larvae or caterpillars.[24]: 21  The offspring's consumption of milkweed benefits health and helps defend them against predators.[34][35] Monarchs lay eggs along the southern migration route.[36]</p>
                <h3 id="Larva">Larva</h3>
                <p>The larva (caterpillar) has five stages (instars), molting at the end of each instar. Instars last about 3 to 5 days, depending on factors such as temperature and food availability.[6][37]</p>
                <p>The first-instar caterpillar that emerges from the egg is pale green or grayish-white, shiny, almost translucent, with a large, black head. It lacks banding coloration or tentacles. The larva or caterpillar eats its egg case and begins to feed on milkweed in a circular motion, often leaving a characteristic, arc-shaped hole in the leaf. Older first-instar larvae have dark stripes on a greenish background and develop small bumps that later become front tentacles. The first instar is usually between 2 and 6 mm (0.079 and 0.236 in) long.[37]</p>
                <p>The second-instar larva develops a characteristic pattern of white, yellow, and black transverse bands. The larva has a yellow triangle on the head and two sets of yellow bands around this central triangle. It is no longer translucent and is covered in short setae. Pairs of black tentacles begin to grow, a larger pair on the thorax and a smaller pair on the abdomen. The second instar is usually between 6 mm (0.24 in) and 1 cm (0.39 in) long.[37]</p>
                <p>The third-instar larva has more distinct bands and the two pairs of tentacles become longer. Legs on the thorax differentiate into smaller pairs near the head and larger pairs further back. Third-instar larvae usually feed using a cutting motion on leaf edges. The third instar is usually between 1 and 1.5 cm (0.39 and 0.59 in) long.[37] The fourth-instar larva has a different banding pattern. It develops white spots on the prolegs near its back, and is usually between 1.5 and 2.5 cm (0.59 and 0.98 in) long.[37]</p>
                <p>The fifth-instar larva has a more complex banding pattern and white dots on the prolegs, with small front legs very close to the head. Its length ranges from 2.5 to 4.5 cm (0.98 to 1.77 in).[6][37] The larvae typically chew through a latex vein to relieve the pressure and feed above it. Fifth-instar larvae often chew a notch in the petiole of the leaf they are eating, which relieves the latex pressure and causes the leaf to fall into a vertical position.</p>
                <p>As the caterpillar completes its growth, it is 4.5 cm (1.8 in) long (large specimens can reach 5 cm (2.0 in)) and 7 to 8 mm (0.28 to 0.31 in) wide, and weighs about 1.5 g (0.053 oz), compared to the first instar, which is 2 to 6 mm (0.079 to 0.236 in) long and 0.5 to 1.5 mm (0.020 to 0.059 in) wide. Fifth-instar larvae greatly increase in size and weight. They then stop feeding and are often found far from milkweed plants as they seek a site for pupating.[37] A monarch caterpillar can travel up to 10 meters from its milkweed plant to find a safe place to pupate.[38]</p>
                <p>In a laboratory setting, the fourth- and fifth-instar caterpillar stages showed aggressive behavior with lower food availability. Attacked caterpillars were found to be attacked when feeding on milkweed leaves, and the caterpillars attacked when foraging for milkweed.[39] This demonstrates the aggressive behavior of monarch caterpillars due to the availability of milkweed.</p>
                <h3 id="Pupa">Pupa</h3>
                <p>To prepare for the pupal or chrysalis stage, the caterpillar chooses a safe place for pupation, where it spins a silk pad on a downward-facing horizontal surface. At this point, it turns around and securely latches on with its last pair of hind legs and hangs upside down, in the form of the letter J. After "J-hanging" for about 12–16 hours, it soon straightens out its body and goes into peristalsis some seconds before its skin splits behind its head. It then sheds its skin over a few minutes, revealing a green chrysalis (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLQmrIUILzc). At first, the chrysalis is long, soft, and somewhat amorphous, but over a few hours, it compacts into its distinct shape – an opaque, pale-green chrysalis with small golden dots near the bottom, and a gold-and-black rim around the dorsal side near the top.[40] At first, its exoskeleton is soft and fragile, but it hardens and becomes more durable within about a day. At this point, it is about 2.5 cm (0.98 in) long and 10–12 mm (0.39–0.47 in) wide, weighing about 1.2 g (0.042 oz). At normal summer temperatures, it matures in 8–15 days (usually 11–12 days). During this pupal stage, the adult butterfly forms inside. A day or so before emerging, the exoskeleton first becomes translucent and the chrysalis more bluish. Finally, within 12 hours or so, it becomes transparent, revealing the black and orange colors of the butterfly inside before it ecloses (emerges).[41]</p>
                <p>In 2009, monarchs were reared on the International Space Station, successfully emerging from pupae located in the station's Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus.[42]</p>
                <h3 id="Adult">Adult</h3>
                <p>The adult emerges from its chrysalis after about two weeks of pupation (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQDGizDHVs8 ). The emergent adult hangs upside down for several hours while it pumps fluids and air into its wings, which expand, dry, and stiffen. The butterfly then extends and retracts its wings. Once conditions allow, it flies and feeds on many nectar plants. During the breeding season, adults reach sexual maturity in 4–5 days. However, the migrating generation does not reach maturity until overwintering is complete.[43]</p>
                <p>The adult's wingspan ranges from 8.9 to 10.2 centimetres (3.5 to 4.0 in).[10] The upper sides of the wings are tawny orange, the veins and margins are black, and two series of small white spots occur in the margins. Monarch forewings also have a few orange spots near their tips. Wing undersides are similar, but the tips of forewings and hindwings are yellow-brown instead of tawny orange and the white spots are larger.[44] The shape and color of the wings change at the beginning of the migration and appear redder and more elongated than later migrants.[45] Wings size and shape differ between migratory and nonmigratory monarchs. Monarchs from eastern North America have larger and more angular forewings than the western population.[24]</p>
                <p>In eastern North American populations, overall wing size in the physical dimensions of wings varies. Males tend to have larger wings than females and are typically heavier than females. Both males and females have similar thoracic dimensions. Female monarchs tended to have thicker wings, which are thought to convey greater tensile strength and reduce the likelihood of being damaged during migration. Additionally, females had lower wing loading than males, meaning females require less energy to fly.[46]</p>
                <p>Adults are sexually dimorphic. Males are slightly larger than females and have a black spot on a vein on each hindwing. The spots contain androconial scales that produce pheromones that many Lepidoptera use during courtship. Females are often darker than males and have wider veins on their wings. The ends of the abdomens of males and females differ in shape.[24][44][47][48]</p>
                <p>The adult thorax has six legs, but like all Nymphalidae, the forelegs are small and held against the body. The butterfly uses only its middle and hind legs when walking and clinging.[49]</p>
                <p>Adults typically live for 2–5 weeks during their breeding season.[24]: 22–23  Larvae growing in high densities are smaller, have lower survival, and weigh less as adults compared with those growing in lower densities.[50]</p>
                <h3 id="Male">Male</h3>
                <p>Male monarch butterflies can be distinguished from females by the small, black, fuzzy spots on their hind wings, which are scent glands used for courtship, and by their slightly thinner black wing veins.[51]</p>
                <h3 id="Female">Female</h3>
                <p>Female monarch butterflies lack these spots, have a more orange-brown appearance, and generally have thicker, wider black wing veins than males. Key Differences</p>
