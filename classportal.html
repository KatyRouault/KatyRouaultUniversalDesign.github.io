                  <h2>About me</h2>
                  <p>Hello! My name is Katy Rouault, and I am an engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technology and Design, a program that allows me to combine creativity with technical problem-solving. Through my coursework, I have explored a wide range of topics including coding, design thinking, and interactive media, all of which have helped me better understand how technology can be used as a tool for creativity and positive impact.</p>

                  <h3 id="Lab-2">Lab 2 - Coding & Posting a Web Page - The Basics</h3>
                  <p>This project involved recreating a multi-page Wikipedia article using semantic HTML5 structure, with sections organized through header, navigation, section, article, and footer elements. Anchor links provided smooth in-page navigation, while images were downloaded, optimized, and properly attributed. CSS was applied to enhance readability, hide elements visually but keep them accessible to screen readers, and maintain an optimal line length. The design used two Google Fonts (serif and sans-serif) and a color-blind–safe palette from Adobe Color. The final page was validated and tested for structure, contrast, and accessibility using HTML5 Outliner, W3C Validator, WAVE, and Silktide.<a href="https://katyrouault.github.io/KatyRouaultUniversalDesign.github.io/semantic-outline.html">Project Link</a></p>
                  <h3 id="Lab-3">Lab 3 - Tables, Forms, Tabbed Browsing, and Screen Reading</h3>
                  <p>This project involved creating a fully structured and accessible HTML5 webpage using real, meaningful content (“lifted content” rather than filler text). The page incorporated specific semantic HTML5 elements, an accessible form, and an accessible data table. It also included a CSS-based skip navigation dropdown for improved keyboard usability, Google Fonts for typography, and Google Material Icons hidden from screen readers. The design emphasized legibility and accessibility, validated through HTML Validator, WAVE, Silktide, HTML Outliner, and Lighthouse. As part of the project, screen readers (VoiceOver or NVDA) were used to navigate and evaluate accessibility firsthand, providing insight into user experiences for those relying on assistive technologies. <a href="https://katyrouault.github.io/KatyRouaultUniversalDesign.github.io/project5.html">Project Link</a></p>
                  <h3 id="Lab-4">Lab 4 - Accessible CSS Layout</h3>
                  <p>This project focused on building a responsive, multi-column webpage structured with header, navigation, main content, two asides, and footer. The overall two-dimensional layout was created using CSS Grid, while the navigation links were arranged with Flexbox for a one-dimensional layout. Viewport settings and media queries were applied to optimize the layout for tablet and mobile devices, including reordering elements and converting the navigation from a horizontal layout to a vertical, thumb-friendly format on mobile. The design incorporated two Google Fonts, a color palette from Adobe Color, and accessibility-focused adjustments. The final page was validated using the W3C HTML Validator, HTML Outliner, and WAVE, and was tested with a screen reader to ensure accessibility before being published via GitHub Pages. <a href="https://katyrouault.github.io/KatyRouaultUniversalDesign.github.io/grid-flex.html">Project Link</a></p>
                  <h3 id="Lab-5">Lab 5 - Universal Design Website</h3>
                  <p>This project centered on creating an informative, multi-page website that introduces and supports universal design for a new generation of web designers. The site was organized into dedicated sections explaining the purpose of universal design, its core principles, and the technical methods used to implement it. Built with a mobile-first, responsive approach, the design prioritizes usability, readability, and inclusive interaction across screen sizes. Accessible coding practices, semantic HTML, and thoughtful visual design choices were used throughout, and the site was evaluated using automated validation tools and screen reader testing to ensure it meets accessibility standards. The final website was deployed using GitHub Pages and presented as an accessible digital resource. <a href="https://katyrouault.github.io/KatyRouaultUniversalDesign.github.io/Universal-Design-Website.html">Project Link</a></p>

                <h2>This Page</h2>
                <p>This page serves as a collection of links to my coding assignments for this class, showcasing the different projects and skills I have developed along the way. Each project has challenged me to think critically, experiment with new ideas, and learn more about how design and technology intersect.</p>
                <p>I have always been drawn to UX/UI design because I love crafting experiences that are intuitive, engaging, and human-centered. However, after taking this class, I have become even more interested in universal design and how thoughtful, inclusive approaches can make digital experiences accessible to people of all backgrounds and abilities. I am excited to continue exploring how design and technology can come together to create meaningful, inclusive solutions for the future.</p>

                <h2>More about this class</h2>
                <p class="more-aside">This course explores the principles, standards, and techniques for creating websites that are accessible, inclusive, and effective across a wide range of users and devices. Emphasizing Universal Design, Web Standards, and accessibility best practices, the class covers topics such as semantic HTML, structured web design, user-centered design, mobile accessibility, and validation tools. Students engage with readings, expert resources, and video lectures to understand how cognitive and design theories impact usability and access. By the end of the course, students will be able to evaluate, code, and design web content that meets accessibility guidelines, supports diverse user needs, and adheres to modern web development standards.</p>
