                  <h2>About me</h2>
                  <p>Hello! My name is Katy Rouault and I am an engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder.
                    I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technology and Design. This page will hold links to all of
                    my coding assignments for this class.</p>
                  <h2>Labs</h2>
                  <h3 id="Lab-2">Lab 2 - Coding & Posting a Web Page - The Basics</h3>
                  <p>This project involved recreating a multi-page Wikipedia article using semantic HTML5 structure, with sections organized through header, navigation, section, article, and footer elements. Anchor links provided smooth in-page navigation, while images were downloaded, optimized, and properly attributed. CSS was applied to enhance readability, hide elements visually but keep them accessible to screen readers, and maintain an optimal line length. The design used two Google Fonts (serif and sans-serif) and a color-blind–safe palette from Adobe Color. The final page was validated and tested for structure, contrast, and accessibility using HTML5 Outliner, W3C Validator, WAVE, and Silktide.<a href="https://katyrouault.github.io/KatyRouaultUniversalDesign.github.io/semantic-outline.html">Project Link</a></p>
                  <h3 id="Lab-3">Lab 3 - Tables, Forms, Tabbed Browsing, and Screen Reading</h3>
                  <p>This project involved creating a fully structured and accessible HTML5 webpage using real, meaningful content (“lifted content” rather than filler text). The page incorporated specific semantic HTML5 elements, an accessible form, and an accessible data table. It also included a CSS-based skip navigation dropdown for improved keyboard usability, Google Fonts for typography, and Google Material Icons hidden from screen readers. The design emphasized legibility and accessibility, validated through HTML Validator, WAVE, Silktide, HTML Outliner, and Lighthouse. As part of the project, screen readers (VoiceOver or NVDA) were used to navigate and evaluate accessibility firsthand, providing insight into user experiences for those relying on assistive technologies. <a href="https://katyrouault.github.io/KatyRouaultUniversalDesign.github.io/project5.html">Project Link</a></p>
                  <h3 id="Lab-4">Lab 4 - Accessible CSS Layout</h3>
                  <p>This project focused on building a responsive, multi-column webpage structured with header, navigation, main content, two asides, and footer. The overall two-dimensional layout was created using CSS Grid, while the navigation links were arranged with Flexbox for a one-dimensional layout. Viewport settings and media queries were applied to optimize the layout for tablet and mobile devices, including reordering elements and converting the navigation from a horizontal layout to a vertical, thumb-friendly format on mobile. The design incorporated two Google Fonts, a color palette from Adobe Color, and accessibility-focused adjustments. The final page was validated using the W3C HTML Validator, HTML Outliner, and WAVE, and was tested with a screen reader to ensure accessibility before being published via GitHub Pages. <a href="https://katyrouault.github.io/KatyRouaultUniversalDesign.github.io/grid-flex.html">Project Link</a></p>

                <h2>More about this class</h2>
                <p>This course explores the principles, standards, and techniques for creating websites that are accessible, inclusive, and effective across a wide range of users and devices. Emphasizing Universal Design, Web Standards, and accessibility best practices, the class covers topics such as semantic HTML, structured web design, user-centered design, mobile accessibility, and validation tools. Students engage with readings, expert resources, and video lectures to understand how cognitive and design theories impact usability and access. By the end of the course, students will be able to evaluate, code, and design web content that meets accessibility guidelines, supports diverse user needs, and adheres to modern web development standards.</p>
