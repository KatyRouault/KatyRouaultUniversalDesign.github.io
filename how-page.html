                  <h2>How</h2>
                  <h3 id="plan">Planning & information architecture</h3>
                  <p>Universal Design starts long before any code is written, during the planning of a site’s structure and user experience. Information architecture, wireframes, and user flows determine how easily users can find information and complete tasks. Organizing content clearly reduces cognitive overload and prevents confusion for users with different abilities, devices, and levels of technical skill. Wireframes focus on layout and hierarchy without visual distractions, while user flows map how real users move through a site. Designing with accessibility in mind at this stage prevents barriers instead of trying to fix them later.</p>
                  <h3 id="semantic">Semantic HTML5 structure</h3>
                  <p>Semantic HTML5 provides the essential structure that makes websites accessible and understandable. Using meaningful elements like header, nav, main, section, and footer allows screen readers and other assistive technologies to interpret the page layout correctly. Proper use of headings, links, buttons, and images, along with clear alt text, ensures that content is communicated accurately to all users. When semantic structure is used correctly, websites become easier to navigate, more consistent, and more compatible across devices and assistive tools.</p>
                  <h3 id="css">Legible & accessible CSS</h3>
                  <p>Strong color contrast between text and background is essential for making content readable for users with low vision, color blindness, or those viewing screens in poor lighting conditions. High contrast helps separate foreground content from the background so information is not lost or visually overwhelming. Light text on dark backgrounds or dark text on light backgrounds must be chosen carefully to avoid eye strain, especially for large blocks of body copy. When contrast is used intentionally, it improves both accessibility and overall visual clarity without sacrificing design quality.</p>
                  <p>Responsive typography ensures that text remains readable across different screen sizes, resolutions, and user settings. Typography choices should prioritize clear, simple typefaces and limit the number of fonts to reduce visual clutter and improve consistency. Headings, subheadings, and body text must be visually distinct to support scanning and comprehension. Proper line length, spacing, and alignment also contribute to legibility by preventing eye fatigue and guiding the reader smoothly through content. When typography adapts to different devices while remaining clear and structured, it becomes a powerful accessibility tool.</p>
                  <p>Scalable units such as em and rem allow text and layout elements to resize based on user preferences and device settings, unlike fixed pixel values that can restrict accessibility. When users increase text size in their browser, scalable units ensure that the layout adjusts without breaking or overlapping content. This flexibility supports users with visual impairments and those who rely on custom viewing settings. By designing with relative units, developers create interfaces that remain usable and readable across a wide range of screen sizes, resolutions, and assistive technologies.</p>
                  <h3 id="ux">UX/UI best practices</h3>
                  <p>Consistency in UX/UI design helps users learn how a website works and reduces cognitive load as they move from page to page. When navigation, typography, colors, and layout remain predictable, users can focus on the content instead of relearning the interface. Consistent alignment, spacing, and visual hierarchy also create a sense of balance and professionalism that makes a site feel trustworthy and easy to use. From an accessibility perspective, consistency is especially important for users with cognitive disabilities, as predictable patterns make interaction less overwhelming and more intuitive.</p>
                  <p>Clear interactions ensure that users understand what actions are possible and what will happen when they engage with an element. Buttons should look clickable, links should be visually distinct, and form fields should clearly indicate how they should be used. Visual cues such as spacing, alignment, and contrast help guide users through tasks without confusion. When interactions are ambiguous or hidden, users may become frustrated or unable to complete essential tasks. Designing clear interactions supports both usability and accessibility by making every function easy to identify and operate.</p>
                  <p>Inclusive visual design considers users with a wide range of abilities, devices, and environments by prioritizing clarity, flexibility, and readability. This includes using strong contrast, legible typography, balanced spacing, and layouts that adapt across screen sizes. Visual design should support content rather than overwhelm it, using white space and alignment to guide attention naturally. Inclusive design also avoids relying on color alone to convey meaning and ensures that visual elements work alongside assistive technologies. When visual design is inclusive, it strengthens both the user experience and overall accessibility.</p>
                  <h3 id="design">Responsive design techniques</h3>
                  <p>Flexbox and CSS Grid are foundational layout tools used to build responsive and accessible web interfaces. Flexbox is best for one-dimensional layouts, such as navigation bars or evenly spaced content rows, while Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts that control both rows and columns. These systems allow designers to create flexible structures that adapt naturally to different screen sizes without breaking content flow. Using fractional units, auto-fitting columns, and responsive alignment ensures layouts remain readable, organized, and visually balanced across devices.</p>
                  <p>Media queries allow designers to apply different styles based on screen size, orientation, and device capabilities. They are essential for adjusting layouts, font sizes, spacing, and navigation patterns so content remains usable on phones, tablets, and desktops. By responding to changes in viewport width, designers can prevent overcrowded layouts and ensure that interactive elements remain appropriately sized for touch or pointer input. Media queries support accessibility by adapting designs to real-world user contexts, including small screens and varying environments.</p>
                  <p>Mobile-first design begins with the smallest screen and builds upward, ensuring that core content and functionality remain the top priority. This approach improves performance, readability, and accessibility by forcing designers to simplify layouts and focus on essential interactions. As screen size increases, additional layout complexity can be layered in using Grid, Flexbox, and media queries. Mobile-first design aligns with accessibility guidelines by supporting touch interaction, small screens, and varied input methods from the start rather than as an afterthought.</p>
                  <h3 id="meta">Metadata & ARIA basics</h3>
                  <p>Accessible titles provide the first and most important layer of meaning for screen reader users. Page titles, headings, and component titles allow users to understand where they are on a site and what content to expect. Clear, descriptive titles improve navigation, orientation, and searchability, especially for users who rely on heading shortcuts to move through content quickly. When titles are vague, duplicated, or missing, users can become disoriented and unable to efficiently locate information.</p>
                  <p>Descriptions give users additional context about content and interactive elements, especially when labels alone are not enough. Using tools like aria-describedby allows designers to associate instructions, requirements, or error messages directly with form fields and controls. These descriptions are read by assistive technologies after labels, helping users understand how to interact with content correctly. When used intentionally and sparingly, descriptions enhance usability without overwhelming the user.</p>
                  <p>Landmarks define the major structural regions of a web page, allowing users of screen readers to navigate quickly between key areas such as the header, navigation, main content, and footer. When built with native HTML elements like header, nav, main, aside, and footer, these regions create a clear, logical page layout that assistive technologies recognize automatically. Landmarks support efficient keyboard navigation and allow users to skip repetitive content, such as jumping directly to the main content of a page. A well-labeled landmark structure dramatically improves page orientation and flow.</p>
                  <p>ARIA should only be used when native HTML cannot provide the necessary accessibility, not as a replacement for proper semantic markup. The first rule of ARIA is to rely on standard HTML whenever possible, since misuse of ARIA can override helpful built-in semantics and actually create new barriers. ARIA is most appropriate for custom interactive components, dynamic updates, and advanced widgets that HTML alone cannot describe. When used correctly and tested with assistive technologies, ARIA enhances accessibility, but when used unnecessarily, it often causes more harm than good.</p>
                  <h3 id="build">Building for assistive tech compatibility</h3>
                  <p>Keyboard navigation is essential for users who cannot use a mouse due to motor, visual, or temporary impairments. All interactive elements such as links, buttons, forms, and menus must be reachable and operable using only the keyboard, typically through the Tab, Enter, and Arrow keys. A visible focus indicator is critical so users can see where they are on the page as they move through content. When websites are not fully keyboard-accessible, users can become trapped or unable to complete tasks, creating a major accessibility barrier.</p>
                  <p>Screen reader–friendly structure relies on clean semantic HTML, properly ordered headings, labeled form elements, and meaningful landmarks. Screen readers interpret the structure of a page rather than its visual layout, so content must be organized in a logical reading order. Correct use of headings, lists, navigation regions, and descriptive link text allows users to scan and navigate efficiently. When structure is inconsistent or purely visual, screen reader users lose critical context, making the site frustrating or impossible to use.</p>
                  <h3 id="how">How to test accessibility</h3>
                  <p>Automated accessibility tools help identify common issues such as missing alt text, low color contrast, improper heading structure, and form labeling errors. These tools quickly scan a site’s code and provide reports that highlight violations of accessibility standards, making them a useful first step in testing. While automated tools are efficient and catch many technical problems, they cannot detect every issue, especially those related to user experience, meaning they should be used alongside manual testing rather than as the only evaluation method.</p>
                  <p>Manual testing is critical because it reveals real usability and accessibility barriers that automated tools often miss. This includes navigating a site using only a keyboard, testing with screen readers, checking text resizing, and evaluating whether instructions and interactions are clear. Manual testing helps designers understand how people with different abilities actually experience a site. It also allows designers to assess logical reading order, focus behavior, and whether content remains usable under different conditions.</p>
                  <p>Testing accessibility on both mobile and desktop devices is essential because users interact with content differently across platforms. Touch gestures, screen sizes, orientation, and built-in accessibility tools vary between devices, which can reveal unique issues that do not appear on desktop. A design that works well with a mouse may fail with touch navigation or small screens if not tested properly. Ensuring accessibility across platforms supports a wider range of users and reinforces inclusive design as a consistent experience rather than a single-device solution.</p>
